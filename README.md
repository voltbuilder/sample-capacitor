# sample-capacitor

A simple Capacitor app for use with VoltBuilder.

This is based on [capacitor-plugin-demo](https://github.com/robingenz/capacitor-plugin-demo), a simple Ionic Angular app to demonstrate the use of certain Capacitor plugins.

## How to run

1. Download the project as a [zip file](https://github.com/voltbuilder/sample-capacitor/archive/refs/heads/main.zip).
1. Zip the capacitor-plugin-demo-main folder.
1. [Upload to VoltBuilder](https://volt.build/upload/) using the Android option.
1. Wait about a minute for it to finish.
1. Install the apk that is returned onto your device.

## iOS

iOS Signing requires developer specific files. This project just has placeholders for them, so it will get an error if you try to build it.
You can generate signing files using [VoltSigner](https://voltsigner.com) if you have an Apple Developer account,
then add them to this project.
