# sample-capacitor

A simple Capacitor app for use with VoltBuilder.

This sample uses the first part of the following tutorial:
https://ionicframework.com/docs/angular/your-first-app

The full tutorial was not implemented to keep the sample less complex. The intent is to show how a Capacitor project can be processed with VoltBuilder.

This sample has just been updated to use Capacitor 7. You'll need to use the VoltBuilder Beta to build. Send an email to support@voltbuilder.com to join the beta.

## How to run

1. Download the project as a [zip file](https://github.com/voltbuilder/sample-capacitor/archive/refs/heads/main.zip).
1. Zip the photo-gallery folder.
1. [Upload to VoltBuilder](https://volt.build/upload/) using the Android option.
1. Wait about a minute for it to finish.
1. Install the apk that is returned onto your device.

## iOS

iOS Signing requires developer specific files. This project just has placeholders for them, so it will get an error if you try to build it.
You can generate signing files using [VoltSigner](https://voltsigner.com) if you have an Apple Developer account,
then add them to this project.
